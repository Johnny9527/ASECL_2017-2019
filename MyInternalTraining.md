## ProjectLink Training

Similar to Oracle Agile PLM System, PTC Windchill PLM System is also structured by many different modules. In this repository, I will share 
parts of the internal training material that I made and used to train the internal users of ASECL.

Today I want to talk about ProjectLink, which is used to manage project-related functions within PTC Windchill PLM System 
(similar to PPM module of Oracle Agile PLM System).

As the picture shows above, the red rectangle box on the left-hand side represents the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) of a project, such as phases, 
activities, and deliverables, and ProjectLink can also interact with other modules like PDMLink, which mainly controls documents, PartsLink, which 
mainly controls parts, and MPMLink, which mainly controls routing.

Like Oracle Agile PLM System, PTC Windchill PLM System is also able to communicate with other information systems such as Manufacturing Execution System 
(MES) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System in data transactions within the company.
