As I mentioned in "README.md", during the time working as a PLM System Engineer of ASECL, I designed several customized functions 
by using JAVA programming language.

I was not allowed to take away any code that I wrote within the company, so I will share some of the screenshots that I took in my 
personal handbook.

## Navigation Icon

This customized function shows how to add an additional "Navigation Icon" to the "Browse Panel".

* Step 1: Create a new navigator in "action.xml"
