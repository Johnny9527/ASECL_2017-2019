# ASECL_2017-2019

* After leaving Anselm Inc., I was hired as a PLM System Engineer by ASECL (ASE Chungli), which is one of the branches of ASE Group (the largest "Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test" company around the world).

* Like many other world-leading technology companies such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft, to be able to join the ASE group was usually considered as an achievement by many people, including me. Working at ASECL was definitely a new challenge for me, as I learned lots of things and co-worked with so many intelligent people.

* Although I worked as an Oracle Agile PLM System consultant before, I was expected to learn another PLM System called "PTC Windchill PLM" by my supervisor and department manager. They were expecting me to use my former experience to solve users' requirements of ASECL as an internal consultant, including internal users' training and design customized functions.
